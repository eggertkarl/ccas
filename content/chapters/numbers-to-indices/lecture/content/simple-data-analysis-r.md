# Simple data analysis in R

## Entering data; dataframes

> Several methods exist to enter data into R:
> 
> 1.  Enter directly  $\verb| x<-c(4,3,6,7,8) |$
> 
> 
> 2.  Read in a single vector:  $\verb| x<-scan("filename")|$
> 
> 
> 3.  Use:  $\verb| x<-read.table("file address")|$
> 

### Details

The most direct method will not work if there are a lot numbers;
therefore, the second method is to read in a single vector by
x\<-scan(\"filename\"), \"filename\" = text string, either a full path
name or refers to a file in the working directory.\
The scan() command returns a vector, but the read.table() command
returns a dataframe, which is a rectangular table of data whose columns
have names. A column can be extracted from a data frame, e.g., with x\<-
dat$a where \"dat" is the name of the data frame and \"a\" is the name
of a column.

> **Note**:  
> 
> *Note 8*. Note that for read.table(\"file address\"), \"file address\"
> refers to the location of the file. Thus, it can be the URL or the
> complete file directory depending on where the table is stored.

### Examples

## Histograms

> A histogram is a graphical display of tabulated frequencies, shown as
> bars.
> 
> In R use the command:  $\verb|hist(x)|$

### Examples

A histogram is a graphical display of tabulated frequencies, shown as
bars.

## Bar Charts

> The bars in a bar chart usually correspond to frequencies in categories
> and are therefore kept apart.

> ![Fig. 10](../media/7_3_Bar_Charts.png)

### Details

A bar chart is similar to the histogram but is used for categorical
data.

## Mean, standard error, standard deviations

### Details

The most familiar measure of central tendency is the arithmetic mean.

> **Definition**:  
> 
> An **arithmetic mean** is the sum of the values divided by the number
> values, typically expressed as:
> 
> $$\bar{y} = \frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n} y_i}{n}$$
> 

> **Definition**:  
> 
> The **sample variance** is a measure of the spread of a set of values
> from the mean value:
> 
> $$s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x} )^2$$
> 

The sample standard deviation is more commonly used as a measure of the
spread of a set of values from the mean value.

> **Definition**:  
> 
> The **standard deviation** is the square root of the variance and may be
> expressed as:
> 
> $$s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x} )^2}$$
> 

> **Definition**:  
> 
> The **standard error** is a method used to indicate the reliability of
> the sample mean:
> 
> $$SE_{\bar{y}} = \sqrt{\frac{s^2}{n}}$$
> 

If a vector x in R contains an array of numbers then:\
 $\verb;mean(x);$
 returns the average,  $\bar{x}$
\
 $\verb;sd(x);$
 returns the standard deviation, $s$
\
 $\verb;var(x);$
 returns the variance,  $s^2$
\
\
We may also want to use several other related operations in R:Â 

 $\verb;median(x);$
, the median value in vector x\
 $\verb;range(x);$
, which lists the range:
 $\verb;max(x);-\verb;min(x);$
.\
If the variable  $\verb;x;$
 contains discrete categories,
 $\verb;table(x);$
 returns counts of the frequency in each category.

## Scatter plots and correlations

> If we have paired explanatory and response data we are often interested
> in seeing if a relationship exists between them. To do this, we first
> plot the data in a scatter plot.

### Details

A first step in analyzing data is to prepare different plots. The type
of variable will determine the type of plot. For example, when using a
scatter plot both the explanatory and response data should be continuous
variables.\
The equation for the Pearson correlation coefficient is:

$$r_{x,y} = \frac{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2 \Sigma_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2},$$

where  $\bar{x}$
 and  $\bar{y}$
 are the sample means of the x- and
y-values.

The correlation is always between  $-1$
 and  $1$
.

### Examples

The following R commands can be used to generate a scatter plot for
vectors x and y

> **Example**:  
> 
>     plot(x,y)
